This shows you how you can deploy a backend api and an spa with docker compose and how to pass variables into the app(express)
and how to pass env vars into the docker container if they need to be accessible before the build(vite)

after docker-compose up --build you should be able to access the frontend at localhost:4000 and backend at localhost:8080
